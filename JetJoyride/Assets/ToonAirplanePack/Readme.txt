Customization:

Compressed in the PSDs.zip file you will find 5 different PSDs for each airplane model. Each file contains a set of UV coordinates for the particular model, plus separate layers for each part of the airplane. Use these layers as guidelines to create your own diffuse and specular maps. Once finished, simply export the image as a TGA and replace the existing diffuse texture. Keep in mind that with the current shader, the specular map is taken from the Alpha channel in the diffuse texture.
